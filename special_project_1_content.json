These include the “Digging out With Dignity” conference at Princeton University, co-presented with the Aspen Insitute’s Financial Security Program (October 18, 2019). The “Problem of Colored Lines” gallery is a collaboration between the Dignity + Debt Network and the VizE Lab and is intended to promote data visualization as a medium for depicting racial disparities in student borrowing and repayment, and for rendering data meaningful to wider publics. Taking inspiration from the charts and maps created by sociologist W.E.B Du Bois that depict wealth disparities between blacks and whites, we seek to visualize the color lines and social complexities within urgent issue of student loan debt. Finally, with our interactive debt and repayment visualization, users can compare their own student debt with several US groups and explore ways to reduce their total payments and time to payoff.","objects":{"entry":{"path":"content/projects/special/student-debt-racial-disparities.md","sha":"1cc68fccae68b0521598b296af0785aa3dd9f0e1"},"files":[]},"pr":{"number":79,"head":"47f2cf9c858cff431c781ba62a4b3306b9e59785"},"timeStamp":"2019-10-15T16:30:12.080Z","status":"pending_publish"}
