social_description: The VizE Lab and Dignity+Debt are calling for data
  visualizations, maps, or short documentary films and photography that portray
  student loan debt.
description: The Dignity + Debt Network is working on a number of fronts to
  explore issues and solutions for student loan debt traps. These include the
  recent “Digging out With Dignity” conference at Princeton University,
  co-presented with the Aspen Insitute’s Financial Security Program (October 18,
  2019). The “Problem of Colored Lines” gallery is a collaboration between the
  Dignity + Debt Network and the VizE Lab and is intended to promote data
  visualization as a medium for depicting racial disparities in student
  borrowing and repayment, and for rendering data meaningful to wider publics.
  Taking inspiration from the charts and maps created by sociologist W.E.B Du
  Bois that depict wealth disparities between blacks and whites, we seek to
  visualize the color lines and social complexities within urgent issue of
  student loan debt. With our interactive debt and repayment visualization,
  users can compare their own student debt with several US groups and explore
  ways to reduce their total payments and time to payoff. Finally, our
  visualization contest invites submissions in a range of visual media that can
  help clarify the complexities and broaden the conversation on the student debt
  crisis.

    text: If sociologist W.E.B Du Bois were working on the urgent issue of student
      loan indebtedness, he would find that enduring racial lines and other
      social cleavages help predict how debts are obtained and affect whether
      groups of people are allowed to carry them with dignity.
      Our  visualization gallery "The Problem of Colored Lines" explores these
      inequities in Du Bois's evocative style.
