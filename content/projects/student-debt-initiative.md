      student loan debt traps on a number of fronts. These include the recent
      [“Digging out With
      Dignity”](https://www.dignityanddebt.org/meetings/digging-out-with-dignity-solving-the-student-loan-crisis-and-honoring-meaning-at-the-margins/)
      conference at Princeton University, co-presented with the Aspen Insitute’s
      Financial Security Program (October 18, 2019). In collaboratiom with the
      [VizE Lab](https://vizelab.princeton.edu), our projects in this initiative
      enable scholars, students, and former students to visualize data on the
      enduring social inequalities that structure student debt. We offer means
      to broaden the conversation about the impact of student debt and imagine
      solutions for the student debt crisis and for financing higher education.

    heading: Comparing and Calculating Your Student Debt
    alt: null
    text: In these interactive charts, you can compare your own total student loans
      with the average amounts among several social groups in the US.
      Recalculate your student loan with changes you can make now. Learn how
      much you could save by refinancing or pay down your loan faster by paying
      a little more per month.

    heading: Student Debt and Racial Disparities
    alt: null
    text: If sociologist W.E.B Du Bois were working on the urgent issue of student
      loan indebtedness, he would find that enduring racial lines and other
      social cleavages help predict how debts are obtained and affect whether
      groups of people are allowed to carry them with dignity.
      Our  visualization gallery "The Problem of Colored Lines" explores these
      inequities in Du Bois's evocative style.

      are able to reveal what might be either changed or strengthened through
      policy and individual action. Enter our contest to envision a meaningful
      future of financial autonomy and educational inclusion around the world.
