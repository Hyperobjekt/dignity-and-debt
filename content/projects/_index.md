Participants in the Dignity + Debt Network are engaged in a wide range of projects and collaborations around the world. These undertakings range from social science research that identifies relationships between the cost of doing business in financial services and respect in the consumer experience, to redesigning financial products that promote dignity and respect while increasing revenue, and to increasing the public visibility of the designs and scholarship generated across the Network.
