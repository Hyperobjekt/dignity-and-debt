  The Dignity + Debt Network is working on a number of fronts to explore issues
  and solutions for student loan debt traps. These include the "Digging out With
  Dignity" conference at Princeton University, co-presented with the Aspen
  Insitute's Financial Security Program (October 18, 2019). 


  Our "Problem of Colored Lines" gallery is a collaboration between the Dignity
  + Debt Network and the VizE Lab intended to promote data visualization as a
  medium for depicting racial disparities in student borrowing and repayment,
  and for rendering data meaningful to wider publics. Taking inspiration from
  the charts and maps created by sociologist W.E.B Du Bois depicting wealth
  disparities between blacks and whites, we seek to chart the color lines and
  social complexities in the urgent issue of student debt. Finally, with our
  interactive debt and repayment visualization, users can compare their own
  student debt with several US groups and explore ways to reduce their total
  payments and time to payoff.

The historian and sociologist W.E.B. DuBois believed that social science data should be evocative. In the 2018 essay collection _W.E.B. Du Bois’s Data Portraits: Visualizing Black America_, architecture scholar Mabel O. Wilson describes how Du Bois used infographics and various artistic media to counter assertions by Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel that Africans were “incapable of any development of culture” and that the black experience was characterized by “sensuous arbitrariness.” In the same volume, designer Silas Munro explains just how important the arts were for Du Bois’s scientific argument: “The Du Bois infographics were published twenty years before the founding of Bauhaus,” and their modular style predated “the rise of dominant European avant-garde movements... considered to have their origins in Russian constructivism, De Stijl, and Italian futurism.” Du Bois’s charts are not only both scientific, then, they are evocative and they draw in viewers to explore them closely, raise new questions, and provoke action.

If Du Bois were working the urgent issue of student loan indebtedness today, he would find that what he phrased as _**"the problem of the color line"**_ endures across the globe, and that other social cleavages help predict how debts are arranged and affect whether groups of people are allowed to carry it with dignity. In this growing series of charts created in the [**VizE Lab**](vizelab.princeton.edu) at Princeton, **The Dignity and Debt Network** is adopting the style of Du Bois to convey some of the contemporary research on how color-lines organize data on student debt as well as the social complexity of wider debt traps. That is, we are charting their  interrelated structures, meanings, and values that shape the uneven circumstances with which college students and families take on educational debt, and the ability of graduates to repay them. As we continue to add to this series, we seek to produce a new set of public goods --  visualizations of dignity, respect, and autonomy that can guide meaningful financial and educational inclusion across the globe. We also will feature visualizations of these possible futures in the coming year. Stay tuned.
