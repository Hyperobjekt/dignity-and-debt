  The Dignity + Debt Network is organizing a number of activities that explore
  the issues and solutions for student debt traps. These include the "Digging
  out With Dignity" conference at Princeton University, co-presented with the
  Aspen Insitute's Financial Security Program. Our data visualization contest
  also launches at this meeting.  


  Our "Debt Problems with Colored Lines" visualization gallery is a
  collaboration between the Dignity + Debt Network and the VizE Lab intended to
  promote data visualization as a medium for depicting racial disparities in
  student borrowing and repayment. Taking inspiration from the charts and maps
  created by sociologist W.E.B Du Bois depicting wealth disparities between
  blacks and whites, we seek to chart the color lines and social complexities in
  the urgent  issue of student debt. Finally, with our interactive debt and
  repayment visualization, users can compare their own student debt with several
  US groups and explore ways to reduce their total payments and time to
  payoff.

The historian and sociologist W.E.B. DuBois believed that social science data should be evocative. In the 2018 essay collection _W.E.B. Du Bois’s Data Portraits: Visualizing Black America_, architecture scholar Mabel O. Wilson describes how Du Bois used infographics and various artistic media to counter assertions by Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel that Africans were “incapable of any development of culture” and that the black experience was characterized by “sensuous arbitrariness.” In the same volume, designer Silas Munro explains just how important the arts were for Du Bois’s scientific argument: “The Du Bois infographics were published twenty years before the founding of Bauhaus,” and their modular style predated “the rise of dominant European avant-garde movements... considered to have their origins in Russian constructivism, De Stijl, and Italian futurism.” Du Bois’s charts are not only both scientific, then, they are evocative and they draw in viewers to explore them closely, raise new questions, and provoke action.

If Du Bois were working the urgent issue of student loan indebtedness today, he would find that what he phrased as _"the problem of the color line"_ endures across the globe, and that other social cleavages help predict how debts are arranged and affect whether groups of people are allowed to carry it with dignity. In this growing series of charts created in the [**VizE Lab**](vizelab.princeton.edu) at Princeton, **The Dignity and Debt Network** is adopting the style of Du Bois to convey some of the contemporary research on how color-lines organize data on student debt as well as the social complexity of wider debt traps. That is, we are charting their  interrelated structures, meanings, and values that shape the uneven circumstances with which college students and families take on educational debt, and the ability of graduates to repay them. As we continue to add to this series, we seek to produce a new set of public goods --  visualizations of dignity, respect, and autonomy that can guide meaningful financial and educational inclusion across the globe. 

Our interactive page on **Comparing and Calculating Student Debt** enables users to compare their own student debt with the averages of several social groups in the US. Further, users can learn how much they would save over the life of the loan if they were able to refinance their loans, or more simply, paid a little more per month on their student loan. As portrayed by this gallery, however, we don’t reduce the social complexity of student-debt to an issue for individuals to solve on their own. In addition to what you yourself can do to close the wealth gap, there needs to be policy change. Some have called for baby bonds, seed capital for every child, and student loan amnesties. We also will feature visualizations of these possible futures in the coming year. Stay tuned.

Finally, we want our work to prompt scholars and practitioners to consider creating their own data visualizations and maps as a way of sharing their work. We invite submissions to our **Visualizing Student Debt** contest beginning in October, and are eager to see what our Network produces!
