title: Student Debt and Racial Disparities
is_index: false
type: projects
description: >-
  A collaboration between the Dignity + Debt Network and the VizE Lab intended
  to promote data visualization as a medium for depicting the racial disparities
  and the meanings and values that organize student borrowing and repayment. In
  creating our gallery here, we take inspiration from the series of evocative
  charts and maps created by sociologist W.E.B Du Bois which depict wealth
  disparities between blacks and whites around the turn of the 20th Century in
  the US. Just as Du Bois used visualizations to depict the complexity of these
  disparities, we seek to chart the color lines and social complexity of the
  urgent contemporary issue of student debt. In turn, this growing collection of
  charts will reveal the individual practices, values and institutional change
  needed to expand equitably the benefits of higher education.

**The Problems With Color Lines Gallery**

The historian and sociologist W.E.B. DuBois believed that social science data should be evocative. In the 2018 essay collection _W.E.B. Du Bois’s Data Portraits: Visualizing Black America_, architecture scholar Mabel O. Wilson describes how Du Bois used infographics and various artistic media to counter assertions by Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel that Africans were “incapable of any development of culture” and that the black experience was characterized by “sensuous arbitrariness.” In the same volume, designer Silas Munro explains just how important the arts were for Du Bois’s scientific argument: “The Du Bois infographics were published twenty years before the founding of Bauhaus,” and their modular style predated “the rise of dominant European avant-garde movements... considered to have their origins in Russian constructivism, De Stijl, and Italian futurism.” Du Bois’s charts are not only both scientific, then, they are evocative and they draw in viewers to explore them, raise new questions, and provoke action.

If Du Bois were working the urgent issue of student loan indebtedness today, he would find that what he phrased as _"the problem of the color line"_ endures across the globe, and that other social cleavages help predict how debts are arranged and affect whether groups of people are allowed to carry it with dignity. In this growing series of charts created in the [**VizE Lab**](vizelab.princeton.edu) at Princeton, **The Dignity and Debt Network** is adopting the style of Du Bois to convey some of the contemporary research on how color-lines organize data on student debt as well as the social complexity of wider debt traps. That is, we are charting the interrelated social facts that shape the uneven circumstances and values with which college students take on educational debt, and the ability of graduates to repay them. As we continue to add to this series, we seek to produce a new set of public goods --  visualizations of dignity, respect, and autonomy that can guide meaningful financial inclusion across the globe.

Our interactive page on **Comparing and Calculating Student Debt** enables users to compare their own student debt with the averages of several social groups in the US. Further, users can learn how much they would save over the life of the loan if they were able to refinance their loans, or more simply, paid a little more per month on their student loan. As portrayed by this gallery, however, we don’t reduce the social complexity of student-debt to an issue for individuals to solve on their own. In addition to what you yourself can do to close the wealth gap, there needs to be policy change. Some have called for baby bonds, seed capital for every child, and student loan amnesties. We also will feature visualizations of these possible futures in the coming year. Stay tuned.
