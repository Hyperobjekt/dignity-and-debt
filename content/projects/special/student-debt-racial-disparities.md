description: "The Dignity + Debt Network is working on a number of fronts to
  explore issues and solutions for student loan debt traps. These include the
  recent “Digging out With Dignity” conference at Princeton University,
  co-presented with the Aspen Insitute’s Financial Security Program (October 18,
  2019). The “Problem of Colored Lines” gallery is a collaboration between the
  Dignity + Debt Network and the VizE Lab and is intended to promote data
  visualization as a medium for depicting racial disparities in student
  borrowing and repayment, and for rendering data meaningful to wider publics.
  Taking inspiration from the charts and maps created by sociologist W.E.B Du
  Bois that depict wealth disparities between blacks and whites, we seek to
  visualize the color lines and social complexities within urgent issue of
  student loan debt. With our interactive debt and repayment visualization,
  users can compare their own student debt with several US groups and explore
  ways to reduce their total payments and time to payoff. Finally, our
  visualization contest invites submissions in a range of visual media that can
  help clarify the complexities and broaden the conversation on the student debt
  crisis.  "

  The historian and sociologist W.E.B. DuBois believed that social science data
  should be evocative. In the 2018 essay collection _W.E.B. Du Bois’s Data
  Portraits: Visualizing Black America_, architecture scholar Mabel O. Wilson
  describes how Du Bois used infographics and various artistic media to counter
  assertions by Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel that Africans were “incapable of
  any development of culture” and that the black experience was characterized by
  “sensuous arbitrariness.” In the same volume, designer Silas Munro explains
  just how important the arts were for Du Bois’s scientific argument: “The Du
  Bois infographics were published twenty years before the founding of Bauhaus,”
  and their modular style predated “the rise of dominant European avant-garde
  movements... considered to have their origins in Russian constructivism, De
  Stijl, and Italian futurism.” Du Bois’s charts are both scientific and
  evocative. And they are provocative. They draw in viewers to study them, to
  make new insights, to raise new questions, and to take positive action.


  If Du Bois were working today on the urgent issue of student loan indebtedness, he would find that, in the phrase he used, **"the problem of the color line"** endures across the globe, and that other social cleavages help predict how debts are arranged and affect whether groups of people are allowed to carry it with dignity. Inspired by Du Bois, The Dignity and Debt Network and the [**VizE Lab**](https://vizelab.princeton.edu) at Princeton adopting the style of Du Bois in a growing series of charts that convey some of the contemporary research on how color-lines organize data on student loan debt. Taken together, the series also depict the wider webs of structures, meanings, and values that shape the uneven circumstances with which college students and families take on educational debt, and the ability of graduates to repay them. As we add to this series, we seek to produce a new set of public goods that can reveal areas where policy changes can be made. And they chart how dignity, respect, and autonomy can guide meaningful financial and educational inclusion around the globe. We will be featuring visualizations of these possible futures in the coming year. Stay tuned.
