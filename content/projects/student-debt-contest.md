      ### Can Visualizations Help Solve the Student Loan Debt Crisis?


      Visualizations can render data to make it meaningful for people around the world. Furthermore, they are able to reveal what might be either changed or strengthened through policy and individual action. To draw on this potential, The [VizE Lab](https://vizelab.princeton.edu) and The Dignity+Debt Network are calling for data visualizations, maps, or short documentary films and photography that portray student loan debt. See our own "[The Problem of Colored Lines](https://www.dignityanddebt.org/projects/student-debt-racial-disparities/)" gallery on racial disparities and the student loan crisis, inspired by the drawings of W.E.B. DuBois.
