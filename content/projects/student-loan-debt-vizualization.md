The widest disparity is $8,710 between Blacks and Asians, for example. In these charts, you can view how your own cumulative student loan amount compares with average loan amounts among these groups. In the loan repayment calculator below, you can explore new paths to financial freedom. For instance, can you refinance your loan with a lower interest rate? How much time and interest would you save by adding a little more to your loan payment each month?"
