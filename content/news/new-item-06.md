Frederick Wherry, a professor of sociology at Princeton, calls himself an “accidental sociologist.” Growing up in South Carolina with his twin sister and four brothers, he wanted to be a civil rights lawyer. During his undergraduate years, he traveled to Africa, and after graduation, Asia, leading him to aim for a career in international development.
