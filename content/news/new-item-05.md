The Urban Institute presents a new [series of interactive maps](https://apps.urban.org/features/debt-interactive-map/?type=overall&variable=pct_debt_collections) of failing auto, medical, and student loans across the US. These maps visualize the geography of debt disparities that reinforce existing wealth gaps between white communities and communities of color. The data itself is available to download for further study, and provides links to a number of additional resources for studying and intervening in the debt crisis in America.
