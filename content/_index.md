who_we_are: "Across the globe, individuals use debt to realize their visions of a good life, while a growing number of families fall into life-altering debt. Worried that they will forever be enslaved by it, some parents have trouble sleeping, their health declines, and their relationships sour. Debt also affects the ability to help loved ones live with dignity, whether they be their children or aging parents with inadequate retirement savings. Further, dignity affects self-esteem, motivation and the capacity of individuals to participate effectively in civic life and financial institutions. Any financial propositions that do not include a vision of a dignified life are likely to treat people as if they are robotic quantities, occluding the very moral values that give their sacrifices meaning."
