who_we_are: "Across the globe, a growing number of families fall into life-changing debt. Worried that they will forever be enslaved by it, some parents have trouble sleeping at night. Their health takes a downward turn. As couples struggle over bills, their relationships sour. And some choose not to marry because their debts keep them from providing their loved ones with a dignified life. Debt affects self-esteem and the ability to help loved ones live with dignity, whether they be kids in school or aging parents with inadequate retirement savings. Self-esteem, respect, and dignity, however, also affect the motivation and the capacity of individuals to participate effectively in financial institutions, family life, and civic activities. Individuals use debt to realize their visions of a good life. Any prescriptions that do not include that vision of a dignified life are likely to treat people as if they are robotic quantifiers, occluding the moral values that make their sacrifices make sense."
