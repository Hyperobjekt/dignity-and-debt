  Loans enable people to realize their visions of a good life, yet many families
  across the globe are falling into life-altering debt. Worried that they will
  forever be enslaved by it, some parents have trouble sleeping and their health
  and relationships diminish. Debt affects their ability to help loved ones live
  with dignity, whether they be children or aging parents with inadequate
  resources. Further, debt can reduce self-esteem, motivation, and capacity to
  participate effectively in civic life and financial institutions. Financial
  propositions that lack a vision of dignity treat people like robotic
  quantities, occluding the very moral values that give financial sacrifices
  meaning.
