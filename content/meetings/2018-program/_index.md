<h2> Why Dignity? </h2>

<p>What is dignity and what is its relationship to credit and debt? This panel explores how people experience dignity and seek to affirm it when making decisions about debt. The panel will begin with the question of how the delivery of debt affects individuals’ understandings of themselves as autonomous, self-directed, and respected (like everyone else). The panelists will place these meanings of debt and dignity into natural and laboratory contexts where debt is experienced as dignity-enhancing or degrading.</p>

<h2>Getting Respect</h2>

<p>The book Getting Respect: Responding to Stigma and Discrimination in the United States, Brazil, and Israel (2016) asked how the search for respect shaped how individuals navigated social interactions where they were likely to be disrespected (or believed that they would be). What if a similar question were asked about respect in the context of financial services? And what if a book were written based on experiences in the US, India, Brazil, Argentina, Kenya, South Africa, and elsewhere? What might we learn about the price people are willing to pay to evade situations of acute disrespect and how might financial services be structured to relieve them of those costs while diverting those resources to more productive endeavors? What are different models for structuring debt that attend to gender differences in how respect is activated and mobilized? And how might we navigate a path between experiments and audits, on the one hand, and in-depth interviews and longer-term observations, on the other?</p>

<h2>What's Fair: Demonstrating the Possible</h2>

<p>This panel asks how qualitative field researchers can partner with computational social scientists to explore how consumers think about finance and fairness. What is experienced as fair and respectful when accessing financial services? What are dignity-enhancing versus degrading experiences for consumers when their delin- quent debts are collected? And how do debt collectors and financial service providers think about fairness and respect when interacting with a variety of debtors? The sessions will highlight a new pilot study that is being launched this summer in Kenya, Brazil, and the US, funded by the Mastercard Center for Inclusive Growth.</p>

<h2>The Financial Diaries Challenge</h2>

<p>The Fragile Families Challenge asked: “What would happen if hundreds of social scientists and data scientists worked together on a scientific challenge to improve the lives of disadvantaged children in the United States?” The Challenge relied on 15 years of data collected by the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study. Although the data had already been used in hundreds of published studies, the Challenge offered an open call to any computational social scientists (no matter their location) to use the existing data to identify unmeasured but important factors for children who were “beating the odds.” It also aimed to identify intervention prior- ities. Currently, the Challenge has moved to deep qualitative dives into the data with follow-up interviewing to sharpen analytic understandings and intervention outcomes. What if a similar challenge could be made to researchers willing to analyze the data collected around the globe from the Financial Diaries studies?</p>

<h2>The Design Challenge: Moving Fast, Thinking Slow</h2>

<p>What would happen if a team of undergraduate, graduate, and post- doctoral fellows as well as community members and industry innovators teamed up to address debt collection and other financial services? How might these partnerships facilitate fast action in an area where research on dignity, respect, and financial services is only just getting underway? What has been the experience of inno- vators trying to create designs to address financial service challenges around the globe? And how are these innovative designs experienced differently by demographic group (gender, age, race/tribe)? The discussion will conclude with a proposal to issue a Tiger Challenge (www.tigerchallenge.princeton.edu), whereby under- graduate students enroll in a two year challenge to address dignity and debt. The discussion will also include the need for a working group to ask how the Tiger Challenge model can be adopted outside of Princeton in other universities, community colleges, and communities of Fintech practice to learn how these different communities think about and apply designs for dignity and inclusion. These design challenges are important for the innovations they produce, but more importantly, they can provide an opportunity for popular participation. Embedding organizational researchers in different types of teams will allow us to capture the ideas and the skepticism that reflect what differently positioned people value. If we could capture design ideas extolled by different groups of designers (from elite universities to community colleges to entrepreneurial teams scattered across the globe) as well as those ideas that were rejected or not expressed, we can better understand how the human values implicated in financial services are affected by social class and by life experiences.</p>
