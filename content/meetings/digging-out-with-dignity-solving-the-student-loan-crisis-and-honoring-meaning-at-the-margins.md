  Student loans from the federal government total $1.5 trillion in the United
  States with 40 percent of them at risk of default over the next four years.
  Across the globe, student unrest over fines and fees has destabilized plans
  for funding higher education and called to account histories of dispossession.
  While considering what must be done, we must also pay more attention to what
  is at stake.

      Fenaba Addo is the Lorna Jorgensen Wendt Assistant Professor of Money,
      Relationships, and Equality in the School of Human Ecology at the
      University of Wisconsin-Madison. Her research examines the causes and
      consequences of debt disparities and wealth inequality with a focus on
      higher education and family relationships. Widely published in academic
      journals and policy outlets, her work on racial disparities in student
      debt sheds light on the ways that societal inequalities stem from
      historical legacies of racial exclusion and discrimination, and how they
      get reproduced over time. She is currently a visiting professor at the
      Sanford School of Public Policy at Duke University for the 2019-2020
      academic year.

      Rachel Dwyer is Professor of Sociology and Faculty Affiliate of the
      Institute for Population Research at The Ohio State University. She is a
      leading expert on credit, debt, and inequality in the United States. She
      runs “Debt Lab” with a group of OSU students studying how credit and debt
      relations reciprocally intersect structures of social inequality in the
      United States. She also studies the causes and consequences of social
      inequality more broadly, concentrating on growing economic inequality and
      insecurity across classes, including as connected to gender and
      race/ethnic disparities. Several core analytic principles unite her work
      across distinct social arenas: a relational understanding that inequality
      is produced by actors with distinct (often opposing) interests; a focus on
      the institutional rather than exclusively individual factors in
      inequality; and a commitment to the sociology and demography of discovery
      that requires careful attention to historical developments that may be
      unanticipated (and underdetermined) by theory, and which thereby force
      reconsideration of explanatory models. Her research into these issues has
      been funded by the National Science Foundation, the OSU Institute for
      Population Research through a grant from the National Institute for Child
      Health and Human Development, and the National Endowment for Financial
      Education. Her published work has appeared in the American Sociological
      Review, Social Forces, Annual Review of Sociology, Social Science
      Research, Gender & Society, and Social Problems among other top academic
      outlets. She engages policy discussions about youth indebtedness with
      higher education leaders, public policy makers, financial professionals,
      and financial education specialists.

---
The meeting opened with reflections from Frederick Wherry, the Director of Dignity + Debt, on why student debt is central to the work of the Network: “In communities across the country and around the globe, parents take pride in announcing that their kid is going to college. Where I grew up in South Carolina, it was more than just an individual achievement. As a black kid, I was told that education was the one thing they couldn’t take away.

While most of the day focused on the US student loan crisis, the discussion included a panel that compared experiences with students loans and fees across the globe. Participants examined what led to the 1.5 trillion student loan debt crisis, an amount larger than either auto loans or credit card debt. These examinations of what led to the debt and its consequences was followed by prescriptions for what to do about it. Most participants concluded that debt cancellation (which comes in many forms, as described [in this report from the Aspen Institute](https://www.aspeninstitute.org/publications/student-loan-cancellation-assessing-strategies-to-boost-financial-security-and-economic-growth/)) is both possible and necessary. Tressie McMillan Cottom, the recently named National Book Award Finalist for Thick and author of Lower Ed, brought together the need for upstream and downstream reforms, noting: “Student debt cancellation without higher ed reform won’t work. And higher ed reform debt cancellation won’t work either.”

Ida Rademacher from the Aspen Institute’s Financial Security Program noted that we needed to leverage the data and to go beyond it to activate empathy and inspire moral outrage. She encouraged the group to keep in mind not just how to understand but also how to  explain and accelerate action.

And Alondra Nelson, president of the Social Science Research Council, reminded us all that the SSRC started in 1923 with the progressive belief that social science can do good in the world, and the Dignity + Debt Network lives out that mission by toggling between institutions and individuals, historical context and the dynamics of human agency. Only by going across and beyond disciplines and countries will we meet these challenges head on.

## How Did Higher Ed Debt Become Impossible (for some) to Repay?

For some US borrowers, there is no crisis. For the majority, however, there seems to be no end to their sacrifice. Charlie Eaton noted that through an expansion of loans by the 1992 Higher Education Act reauthorization, student debts soared both in total amount of debt and per-student debt burdens. At the same time, per student cuts from state legislatures and the federal government required students to take on a larger share of the rising costs of education. Today, college is rarely debt free except for those from wealthy households who make up a disproportionate share of students at elite private institutions. Also aided by their schools' endowment wealth, only 21 percent of students borrow at all in their first year at the 20 most selective private colleges. Throughout the rest of the higher education system, most students now leave school with the disadvantages of debt. Educational debt is especially crushing for low-income students and studentsof color who have been targeted by for-profit colleges. In a system where the wealthiest 10 percent of colleges can shield their students from debt but the bottom 90 percent cannot, student debt has become a new system of stratification.“

The JP Morgan Chase Institute issued a report on the 4.5 million individuals with Chase banking accounts making tuition payments. Fiona Greig, the Director of Consumer Research at the JPMC Institute, explained that low-income families are less likely to make consistent student loan payments and that the data suggests that there is a need for payment relief. Other work the Institute has done on income volatility suggests that the eligibility for that relief should be dynamic and calculated on a short-term basis.“

According to Jason Houle and Fenaba Addo, other data sources indicate that there are two student loan realities, a bimodal distribution. Houle explained, “We see that student debt is a crisis for black and brown borrowers, but it is less so for white borrowers. In fact, racial disparities are much bigger than social-class-of-origin disparities; black students leave college with almost double the debt of white students; and default rates are almost three times higher for black than white students. The default rate increases dramatically 10-15 years out of college.”

Complicating the story is the finding that wealth is lower for Black families but it also does not protect blacks as much as their white counterparts from debt. Addo remarked, “Wealthy children are more likely to attend and graduate college and finish with less debt, but when you take race into account, that relationship doesn’t hold for black families.” Addo also explained that Black college grad have higher rates of un and under-employment and that they pay back their debts at a slower rate, holding other things equal.

## What Do Others Do?

Looking at higher education financing around the world may provide some lessons for how we in the United States could improve our system. Jonathan Marcus, the higher education editor for the Hechinger Report, explained that his organization is a nonprofit that was created in response to the inability of large publications to cover education. He has traveled the world, looking at the experiences of Australia, Germany, Denmark, Chile, Norway, Iceland, South Africa, and a number of other countries. In other countries, there are powerful national student unions. There are also some surprises. Even where college is “free,” its uptake is not always high. As a journalist not based in these countries, Marcus relies on in-country expertise as he tries to translate their experiences into lessons for a US reading public.

Rekgotsofetse Chikane went into detail on the case of South Africa. As a student leader in the #FeesMustFall movement, he found himself hauled into court accused of treason because he and others stormed the Parliament, demanding the government honor the promises of equality made in 1994. Ironically, his father was charged with treason thirty years earlier for protesting Apartheid. Chicane’s book on the #FeesMustFall movement is now short-listed for South Africa’s Patton Prize.

The debts and the fees get a different response from borrowers depending on how the debts are structured and where the borrowers live. Lorena Pérez-Roa observed how student debtors in Montreal differed from those she interviewed in Santiago. In the former, students saw the problem as one of individual responsibility and most of the family members did not know about their debt burdens. In the latter, the structure of the debt is what has made it impossible to repay. The debts have implicated family members because they are structured to require co-signers. In Chile, students saw themselves as victims of a defective system and they could clearly point to the political regime as blameworthy.

Felipe González-López explained that in Chile, they changed the conversation about debt, transforming it from an individual decision to a collective condition. They changed, “You are not a loan!” And at public assemblies, they structured the gatherings to play a therapeutic role to shift the blame from debtors to eh structures that burden them and the politicians who keep those structures in place.

## What Can Be Done?

According to Danielle Douglas-Gabriel, a reporter at the Washington Post, “Student debt takes a real toll on borrowers, even those who are repaying.” We see those who don’t repay, but we do not see those struggling to repay, wracked by anxiety, unable to save for anything else. We also don’t talk about the fact that the Department of Education hires collection agencies to collect on defaulted debts, and these agencies collect up to 20 percent in extra fees—for those already struggling, more burdens are added. Even borrowers in public service careers who thought that their debts would be forgiven after ten years have learned that a technicality may render nearly all of them ineligible to have the promise fulfilled. These are policy and enforcement choices, Douglas-Gabriel noted. We can choose better.

It would help to change the public narrative about who suffers and how. When students first graduate from college, Rachel Dwyer observed, they may be hopeful that they will land the right job and that they will be able to repay their debts. Over time, however, optimism wanes, along with their sense of mastery and self-esteem. We have nationally representative data that establishes this pattern, but these negative effects are not part of the national conversation. 

How do we change the public’s understanding about why the debt has grown and what consequences it has wrought? Betsy Paluck pointed out, “Our minds respond better to stories than to a litany facts, so it is better to tell an incomplete story that is effective than a complete one that is not.” Eldar Shafir added that we have to stop looking to financial literacy to somehowhelp students make better decisions about how much debt to take on and how to manage repayment. “We have to realize that scarcity limits our cognitive abilities. Rather than change the ‘knowledge’ that individuals have, change the context that drowns them in debt; make the set of decisions they have to make clearer and less cluttered, remove obstacles to getting assistance, and employ empathy that empowers healthier behaviors.” 

Jeff Himpele, director of the [VizE Lab ](https://vizelab.princeton.edu)for Ethnographic Data Visualization, followed this discussion of changing the narrative with the announcement of the Network’s contest to create enduring, compelling images of these new narratives and the various forms of data and social facts underpinning them. Himpele made a direct link to the work of W.E.B. DuBois and recounted discussions a year ago with Wherry to pay homage to DuBois through rendering student loans and other debt data in the evocative visual style DuBois pioneered. From “The Problem of the Color Line” we have moved to [“The Problem of Colored Lines”](http://www.dignityanddebt.org/projects/student-debt-racial-disparities/) with our new gallery of visualizations on the inequities of student loan debt.

The Network’s new [student loan debt calculator ](http://www.dignityanddebt.org/projects/student-debt-calculator/)was launched. Unlike other debt calculators, this one allows an individual to see how changing amount paid per month or changing the interest rate would affect overall amounts repaid. It also shows the individual’s debt relative to the relative debt of others by racial/ethnic category. While the calculator focuses on helping individuals think about repayment costs, it also notes that “There are a number of policy changesthat could make a big difference to your debt burden. These calculators help you figure out what you might do now, bringing your own personal efforts together with larger public solutions.”

## A New Agenda

Opening the discussion on what to do about student debt was Seth Frotman, who helped steer the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s efforts to protect student borrowers. Frotman resigned from the CFPB in 2018 as its Student Loan Umbudsman after he determined that the new direction of the bureau was to shield bad actors from scrutiny at the expense of borrowers.

> “We need to fight the narrative that student loans are ‘good debt.’ That the loans are worth it. People are frustrated. They did what’s ‘right,’ but things still turned out badly.” -@sethfrotman5 <a href="https://twitter.com/share?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" class="twitter-share-button" data-text='“We need to fight the narrative that student loans are ‘good debt.’ That the loans are worth it.

Frotman noted that we need to make sure people are not ripped off when they take out debt of any kind, but especially student loans. Currently, we are not using the normal tools to protect education borrowers that we would use for other loan products. Consequently, many people are getting rich off the plight of students, their co-signers, and their families.

Tressie McMillan Cottom warned, that the good/bad debt narrative is pernicious in public opinion and policymaking. We take higher education and its worth as an article of faith. As such, we are not having a data-driven argument anymore. When talking about debt, we activate ideas about welfare, handouts, the deserving, and the undeserving. If most Americans think that the responsibility for paying for college lies solely with the family and the student, the trillion-dollar figure or the history of how we got here won’t shock them into believing that something else needs to happen. We need to transform the story, bring back bankruptcy, and expand regulatory protections. 

For Darrick Hamilton, this discussion requires us to ask what should be decided by market prices. We step in to say that people have a right to basic protections, especially during a natural disaster. We don’t let gas stations gouge people who are trying to flee a hurricane, for example. But we allow such rip-offs for people escaping poverty and for people pursuing opportunity. Therefore, we have to make this a narrative about right and wrong. We should not be talking about debt forgiveness—who sinned? We should be talking about economic rights and public investments.

## What Happens Now

A Contest to Change the Narrative. The Dignity and Debt Network has launched a contest calling for data visualizations, maps, or short documentary films and photography that portray student loan debt. Works may depict the complex structural conditions of student debt or more personal experiences among debtors and their families. Submissions will be accepted until March 1, 2020. Details can be found here: <http://tinyurl.com/y55ybtdlA> 

Data Gallery to Change the Narrative. As individuals or teams submit their data visualizationsto the contest, we will generate an open commons to share these visualizations. We expect the gallery to be a rich source of visual representations of student debt experiences from across the United States and the globe.

An Open Letter Calling for Debt Cancellation. We are now developing a “letter from concerned professors” about the wellbeing of the students we teach. This letter will circulate across universities in the United States, perhaps the Chronicle of Higher Education, and, if there is funding, in some major newspapers. 

Emergent Collaborations. Our hope is that those who attended the discussion forum and othersacross our network will find areas for collaboration that are spontaneous and that might not havehappened had the network not drawn us all together. What makes the network useful is the extent to which it can catalyze cooperation and encourage the assembly of unorthodox collaborative teams.

Outcome Acceleration. Finally, we will follow-up with our co-presenters at The Aspen Institute’s Financial Security Program and the Expanding Prosperity Impact Collaborative (EPIC) on how to amplify the conversation, the findings, and the ideas for change.
