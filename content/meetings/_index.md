Social Science Research Council President, Alondra Nelson, explained the importance of anticipatory social science for predicting and solving critical problems. And Princeton University President, Christopher Eisgruber, made the case for inequality as a strategic priority for research, teaching, and service.</br>

dignity_roundtable_text: 'The program for the Dignity + Debt Network Roundtable at Princeton began with a "Dignity Roundtable" of panelists describing how dignity and respect appear as motivating values for people using credit and debt. With an economist, a cognitive psychologist, a sociologist, and two anthropologist in dialogue, they explored how people experience dignity and seek to affirm it when making decisions about debt. The panel began with the question of how the delivery of debt affects individuals’ understandings of themselves as autonomous, self-directed, and respected (like everyone else). The panelists placed these meanings of debt and dignity into natural and laboratory contexts where debt is experienced as dignity-enhancing or degrading.'
