why_dignity: "Why are we talking about dignity when talking about debt? Autonomy and protection from abuse. Does debt necessarily erode a person’s autonomy as she decides who she is and to behave as is she has a sense of free will? And when debt result from exploitation and abuse? Can we re-imagine a world in which debt does not have to accompany indignity?"
the_roundtable: "To pursue these questions, the inaugural meeting of the Dignity + Debt Network was held on the campus of Princeton University, at the Carl A. Fields Center for Equality + Cultural Understanding on May 9 and 10, 2018. The Dignity Roundtable included a program of about forty-five scholars and practitioners working in a dozen countries on issues of financial inclusion, household finance, and/or the human values implicated in economic action. The Network’s Director, Frederick Wherry, opened with the question of why questions of dignity and respect are central to understanding debt. Social Science Research Council President, Alondra Nelson, explained the importance of anticipatory social science for predicting and solving critical problems. And Princeton University President, Christopher Eisgruber, made the case for inequality as a strategic priority for research, teaching, and service."
