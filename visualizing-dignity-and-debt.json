We will gather the mental images people construct on paper, in art, in song, in interviews, in testimony, in complaint, and through in vivo as well as virtual observations in which people depict their own debt in relation to their own social status and networks. This aspect of the Networkâ€™s work allows researchers and practitioners to ask how people experience, interpret, and embody different forms of debt. Why do some debts hurt more than others, even when they are mathematically equivalent? And what might be dignity enhancing versus degrading in the experience of debt that is seen, understood, and deeply felt? Scholars engaged in research will also produce a range of data visualizations that make intelligible the complex and sometimes abstract relationships in their data. Taken together, the visualization initiative will extend the work of the Network to reach wider publics and generate support among political leaders, media personalities and businesses that offer financial services.","objects":{"entry":{"path":"content/projects/visualizing-dignity-and-debt.md","sha":"d102b5dff3c06d47aff6447e07a3efd9a4c9a5ee"},"files":[]},"timeStamp":"2019-03-26T13:52:43.377Z"}
