<p>The meeting opened with reflections from Frederick Wherry, the Director of Dignity + Debt, on why student debt is central to the work of the Network: “In communities across the country and around the globe, parents take pride in announcing that their kid is going to college. Where I grew up in South Carolina, it was more than just an individual achievement. As a black kid, I was told that education was the one thing they couldn’t take away. Everything else, including my life, was up for grabs. We sacrificed for self-worth and respect. But we paid dearly for it.”</p>

<p>“As a black kid, I was told that education was the one thing theycouldn’t take away. We sacrificed for self-worth and respect. But wepaid dearly for it.” -@ProfessorWherry</p>

<p>While most of the day focused on the US student loan crisis, the discussion included a panel that compared experiences with students loans and fees across the globe. Participants examined what led to the 1.5 trillion student loan debt crisis, an amount larger than either auto loans or credit card debt. These examinations of what led to the debt and its consequences was followed by prescriptions for what to do about it. Most participants concluded that debt cancellation (which comes in many forms: <a href="https://www.aspeninstitute.org/publications/student-loan-cancellation-assessing-strategies-to-boost-financial-security-and-economic-growth/">https://www.aspeninstitute.org/publications/student-loan-cancellation-assessing-strategies-to-boost-financial-security-and-economic-growth/</a>) is both possible and necessary. Tressie McMillan Cottom, the recently named National Book Award Finalist for Thick and author of Lower Ed, brought together the need for upstream and downstream reforms, noting: “Student debt cancellation without higher ed reform won’t work. And higher ed reform debt cancellation won’t work either.”</p>

<p>“Student debt cancellation without higher ed reform won’t work. Andhigher ed reform without debt cancellation won’t work either.”&ndash;@tressiemcphd</p>

<p>Ida Rademacher from the Aspen Institute’s Financial Security Program noted that we needed to leverage the data and to go beyond it to activate empathy and inspire moral outrage. She encouraged the group to keep in mind not just how to understand but also how to  explain and accelerate action.</p>

<p>“It takes more than understanding the issue of student debt. We haveto get better at explaining and accelerating action.” -@idarademacher</p>

<p>And Alondra Nelson, president of the Social Science Research Council, reminded us all that the SSRC started in 1923 with the progressive belief that social science can do good in the world, and the Dignity + Debt Network lives out that mission by toggling between institutions and individuals, historical context and the dynamics of human agency. Only by going across and beyond disciplines and countries will we meet these challenges head on.</p>

<h3 id="how-did-higher-ed-debt-become-impossible-for-some-to-repay">How Did Higher Ed Debt Become Impossible (for some) to Repay?</h3>

<p>For some US borrowers, there is no crisis. For the majority, however, there seems to be no end to their sacrifice. Charlie Eaton noted that through an expansion of loans by the 1992 Higher Education Act reauthorization, student debts soared both in total amount of debt and per-student debt burdens. At the same time, per student cuts from state legislatures and the federal government required students to take on a larger share of the rising costs of education. Today, college is rarely debt free except for those from wealthy households who make up a disproportionate share of students at elite private institutions. Also aided by their schools&rsquo; endowment wealth, only21 percent of students borrow at all in their first year at the 20 most selective private colleges. Throughout the rest of the higher education system, most students now leave school with the disadvantages of debt. Educational debt is especially crushing for low-income students and studentsof color who have been targeted by for-profit colleges. In a system where the wealthiest 10 percent of colleges can shield their students from debt but the bottom 90 percent cannot, student debt has become a new system of stratification.“</p>

<p>In a system where the wealthiest 10 percent ofcolleges can shield their students from student debt but the bottom 90 percent cannot, student loans havecreated new system of stratification.”&ndash;@CharlieEatonPhD</p>

<p>The JP Morgan Chase Institute issued a report on the 4.5 million individuals with Chase banking accounts making tuition payments. Fiona Greig, the Director of Consumer Research at the JPMCInstitute, explained that low-income families are less likely to make consistent student loan payments and that the data suggests that there is a need for payment relief. Other work the Institute has done on income volatility suggests that the eligibility for that relief should be dynamic and calculated on a short-term basis.“</p>

<p>After reviewing 4.5 million checking accounts of families makingtuition payments, I can say that the data suggests there is a need for
payment relief. The eligibility for that relief should be dynamic andcalculated on a short-term basis.”&ndash;@FionaGreigDC</p>

<p>According to Jason Houle and Fenaba Addo, other data sources indicate that there are two student loan realities, a bimodal distribution. Houle explained, “We see that student debt is a crisis for black and brown borrowers, but it is less so for white borrowers. In fact, racial disparities are much bigger than social-class-of-origin disparities; black students leave college with almost double the debt of white students; and default rates are almost three times higher for black than white students. The default rate increases dramatically 10-15 years out of college.”</p>

<p>“Racial disparities &gt; social-class-of-origin disparities; black studentdebt almost twice white debt; &amp; black default rate X3 of white rate”-@jnhoule</p>

<p>Complicating the story is the finding that wealth is lower for Black families but it also does not protect blacks as much as their white counterparts from debt. Addo remarked, “Wealthy children are more likely to attend and graduate college and finish with less debt, but when you take race into account, that relationship doesn’t hold for black families.” Addo also explained that Black college grad have higher rates of un and under-employment and that they pay back their debts at a slower rate, holding other things equal.</p>

<h3 id="what-do-others-do">What Do Others Do?</h3>

<p>Looking at higher education financing around the world may provide some lessons for how we in the United States could improve our system. Jonathan Marcus, the higher education editor for the Hechinger Report, explained that his organization is a nonprofit that was created in response to the inability of large publications to cover education. He has traveled the world, looking at the experiences of Australia, Germany, Denmark, Chile, Norway, Iceland, South Africa, and a number of other countries. In other countries, there are powerful national student unions. There are also some surprises. Even where college is “free,” its uptake is not always high. As a journalist not based in these countries, Marcus relies on in-country expertise as he tries to translate their experiences into lessons for a US reading public.</p>

<p>Rekgotsofetse Chikane went into detail on the case of South Africa. As a student leader in the #FeesMustFall movement, he found himself hauled into court accused of treason because he and others stormed the Parliament, demanding the government honor the promises of equality made in 1994. Ironically, his father was charged with treason thirty years earlier for protesting Apartheid. Chicane’s book on the #FeesMustFall movement is now short-listed for South Africa’s Patton Prize.</p>

<p>“It doesn’t make much sense to tell people the only way out ofpoverty is a college degree, but the reason they can’t finish the classesis because they can’t afford the fees.”-@Kgotsi_Chikane</p>

<p>The debts and the fees get a different response from borrowers depending on how the debts are structured and where the borrowers live. Lorena Pérez-Roa observed how student debtors in Montreal differed from those she interviewed in Santiago. In the former, students saw the problem as one of individual responsibility and most of the family members did not know about their debt burdens. In the latter, the structure of the debt is what has made it impossible to repay. The debts have implicated family members because they are structured to require co-signers. In Chile, students saw themselves as victims of a defective system and they could clearly point to the political regime as blameworthy.</p>

<p>Felipe González-López explained that in Chile, they changed the conversation about debt, transforming it from an individual decision to a collective condition. They changed, “You are nota loan!” And at public assemblies, they structured the gatherings to play a therapeutic role to shift the blame from debtors to eh structures that burden them and the politicians who keep those structures in place.</p>

<p>“Remember, ‘You are not a loan!’ Stop talking about individual responsibility and start talking about how the loans were structured tobe nearly impossible to repay.”-@Felipe_socec</p>

<h3 id="what-can-be-done">What Can Be Done?</h3>

<p>According to Danielle Douglas-Gabriel, a reporter at the Washington Post, “Student debt takes a real toll on borrowers, even those who are repaying.” We see those who don’t repay, but we do not see those struggling to repay, wracked by anxiety, unable to save for anything else. We also don’t talk about the fact that the Department of Education hires collection agencies to collect on defaulted debts, and these agencies collect up to 20 percent in extra fees—for those already struggling, more burdens are added. Even borrowers in public service careers who thought that their debts would be forgiven after ten years have learned that a technicality may render nearly all of them ineligible to have the promise fulfilled. These are policy and enforcement choices, Douglas-Gabriel noted. We can choose better.</p>

<p>“Student debt takes a real toll on borrowers, even those who arerepaying.”-@DaniDougPost economics of higher ed reporter for@washingtonpost4</p>

<p>It would help to change the public narrative about who suffers and how. When students first graduate from college, Rachel Dwyer observed, they may be hopeful that they will land the right job and that they will be able to repay their debts. Over time, however, optimism wanes, along with their sense of mastery and self-esteem. We have nationally representative data that establishes this pattern, but these negative effects are not part of the national conversation.</p>

<p>How do we change the public’s understanding about why the debt has grown and what consequences it has wrought? Betsy Paluck pointed out, “Our minds respond better to stories than to a litany facts, so it is better to tell an incomplete story that is effective than a complete one that is not.” Eldar Shafir added that we have to stop looking to financial literacy to somehowhelp students make better decisions about how much debt to take on and how to manage repayment. “We have to realize that scarcity limits our cognitive abilities. Rather than change the‘knowledge’ that individuals have, change the context that drowns them in debt; make the set of decisions they have to make clearer and less cluttered, remove obstacles to getting assistance, and employ empathy that empowers healthier behaviors.”</p>

<p>Jeff Himpele, director of the VizE Lab for Ethnographic Data Visualization, followed this discussion of changing the narrative with the announcement of the Network’s contest to create enduring, compelling images of these new narratives and the various forms of data and social facts underpinning them. Himpele made a direct link to the work of W.E.B. DuBois and recounted discussions a year ago with Wherry to pay homage to DuBois through rendering student loans and other debt data in the evocative visual style DuBois pioneered. From “The Problem of the Color Line” we have moved to “The Problem of Colored Lines”: <a href="http://www.dignityanddebt.org/projects/student-debt-racial-disparities/">http://www.dignityanddebt.org/projects/student-debt-racial-disparities/</a></p>

<p>The Network’s new student loan debt calculator was launched: <a href="http://www.dignityanddebt.org/projects/student-debt-calculator/">http://www.dignityanddebt.org/projects/student-debt-calculator/</a>. Unlike other debt calculators, this one allows an individual to see how changing amount paid per month or changing the interest rate would affect overall amounts repaid. It also shows the individual’s debt relative to the relative debt of others by racial/ethnic category. While the calculator focuses on helping individuals think about repayment costs, it also notes that “There are a number of policy changesthat could make a big difference to your debt burden. These calculators help you figure out what you might do now, bringing your own personal efforts together with larger public solutions.”</p>

<h3 id="a-new-agenda">A New Agenda</h3>

<p>Opening the discussion on what to do about student debt was Seth Frotman, who helped steer the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s efforts to protect student borrowers. Frotman resigned from the CFPB in 2018 as its Student Loan Umbudsman after he determined that the new direction of the bureau was to shield bad actors from scrutiny at the expense of borrowers.</p>

<p>“We need to fight the narrative that student loans are ‘good debt.’ That the loans are worth it. People are frustrated. They did what’s ‘right,’but things still turned out badly.” -@sethfrotman5</p>

<p>Frotman noted that we need to make sure people are not ripped off when they take out debt of any kind, but especially student loans. Currently, we are not using the normal tools to protect education borrowers that we would use for other loan products. Consequently, many people are getting rich off the plight of students, their co-signers, and their families.</p>

<p>Tressie McMillan Cottom warned, that the good/bad debt narrative is pernicious in public opinion and policymaking. We take higher education and its worth as an article of faith. As such, we are not having a data-driven argument anymore. When talking about debt, we activate ideas about welfare, handouts, the deserving, and the undeserving. If most Americans think that the responsibility for paying for college lies solely with the family and the student, the trillion-dollar figure or the history of how we got here won’t shock them into believing that something else needs to happen. We need to transform the story, bring back bankruptcy, and expand regulatory protections.</p>

<p>For Darrick Hamilton, this discussion requires us to ask what should be decided by market prices. We step in to say that people have a right to basic protections, especially during a natural disaster. We don’t let gas stations gouge people who are trying to flee a hurricane, for example. But we allow such rip-offs for people escaping poverty and for people pursuing opportunity. Therefore, we have to make this a narrative about right and wrong. We should not be talking about debt forgiveness—who sinned? We should be talking about economic rights and public investments.</p>

<p>“We need a race and gender conscious Economic Bill of Rights that learns and improves upon the New Dealversion. This time, instead of intentionally excludingblacks while benefiting whites, we can authenticallyensure prosperity for all.” -@DarrickHamilton</p>

<h3 id="what-happens-now">What Happens Now</h3>

<p>A Contest to Change the Narrative. The Dignity and Debt Network has launched a contest callingfor data visualizations, maps, or short documentary films and photography that portray student loan debt. Works may depict the complex structural conditions of student debt or more personal experiences among debtors and their families. Submissions will be accepted until March 1, 2020. Details can be found here: <a href="http://tinyurl.com/y55ybtdlA">http://tinyurl.com/y55ybtdlA</a></p>

<p>Data Gallery to Change the Narrative. As individuals or teams submit their data visualizationsto the contest, we will generate an open commons to share these visualizations. We expect thegallery to be a rich source of visual representations of student debt experiences from across thecountry and the globe.</p>

<p>An Open Letter Calling for Debt Cancellation. We are now developing a “letter from concerned professors” about the wellbeing of the students we teach. This letter will circulate across universities in the United States, perhaps the Chronicle of Higher Education, and, if there is funding, in some major newspapers.</p>

<p>Emergent Collaborations. Our hope is that those who attended the discussion forum and othersacross our network will find areas for collaboration that are spontaneous and that might not havehappened had the network not drawn us all together. What makes the network useful is the extentto which it can catalyze cooperation and encourage the assembly of unorthodox collaborativeteams.</p>

<p>Outcome Acceleration. Finally, we will follow-up with our co-presenters at The Aspen Institute’s Financial Security Program and the Expanding Prosperity Impact Collaborative (EPIC) on howto amplify the conversation, the findings, and the ideas for change.</p>
