Student loans from the federal government total $1.5 trillion in the United States with 40 percent of them at risk of default over the next four years. Across the globe, student unrest over fines and fees has destabilized plans for funding higher education and called to account histories of dispossession.</description>

      <description>Average cumulative loan amounts vary among bachelor degree completers in the four largest groups of ancestry in the United States.* The widest disparity is $8,710 between Blacks and Asians, for example. In these charts, you can view how your own cumulative student loan amount compares with average loan amounts among these groups. In the loan repayment calculator below, you can explore new paths to financial freedom. For instance, can you refinance your loan with a lower interest rate?</description>

      <description>How can debt traps be made visually clear while not also rendering those who succumb to those traps as unthinking dupes? And how can the visualization of debt traps and of the indignities of debt collection differentially be used to understand and to change those processes? The Dignity and Debt Network visualization initiative will develop a new set of public goods, visualizations of dignity, respect, and autonomy alongside data on debt, debt traps, and meaningful financial inclusion across the globe.</description>

      <description>This project asks what are the folk understandings of fairness when using financial services and, in particular, when dealing with consumer financial service providers and debt collectors. What metaphors and images are used to relay the experience of fairness or unfairness, of respect or disrespect? Using computational techniques to analyze thousands of textual complaints from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (USA), the Public Defender Office of Over-Indebtedness (Brazil), and a private sector consumer complaints database in Brazil as well as discussions on Twitter and other social media platforms about financial service providers acting unfairly or disrespectfully.</description>

      <description>Research teams working in about a dozen countries are assembling data on debt and human values, namely dignity, respect, and economic morality. Team members include qualitative researchers, computational social scientists, and quantitative analysts. These teams are developing insights into financial well-being that goes beyond how much people need and how much they owe. We investigate the meaningful qualities of economic life that inform the decisions consumers make about educating and providing for their children, finding a safe place to live, and participating honorably in their communities.</description>

      <description>Collecting between 240 and 300 interviews in four to six countries as well as direct observations of consumers, this project asks individuals when they have experienced (or believed they would experience) disrespect or respect while trying to access formal financial services. The project also asks how they evade, manage, or transform these experiences as well as what these strategies look like and how they are remembered (visualized). The country teams available to participate are in Brazil, Argentina, Kenya, South Africa, India, and Russia.</description>

      <description>Collaborating with the Keller Center at Princeton, this project would innovate on the Tiger Challenge model to assemble undergraduate and graduate students alongside practitioners and beneficiaries to modify existing financial products and to build new ones. The project would include measures of dignity and respect to assess whether dignity has a payoff for service providers (repayment likelihoods) and for consumers (attitudes towards financial services, their willingness to pursue full financial inclusion, and their financial well-being).</description>

      <description>For many borrowers, obtaining a home mortgage, car loan, or credit card is a relatively simple process. A bank looks up their credit score — measured on a scale of 300 to 850 — to determine their past financial behavior. For some 45 million Americans, however, that assessment is not possible.</description>
