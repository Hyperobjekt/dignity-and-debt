      <description>Research teams working in about a dozen countries are assembling data on debt and human values, namely dignity, respect, and economic morality. Team members include qualitative researchers, computational social scientists, and quantitative analysts. These teams are developing insights into financial well-being that goes beyond how much people need and how much they owe. We investigate the meaningful qualities of economic life that inform the decisions consumers make about educating and providing for their children, finding a safe place to live, and participating honorably in their communities.</description>

      <description>This project asks what are the folk understandings of fairness when using financial services and, in particular, when dealing with consumer financial service providers and debt collectors. What metaphors and images are used to relay the experience of fairness or unfairness, of respect or disrespect? Using computational techniques to analyze thousands of textual complaints from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (USA), the Public Defender Office of Over-Indebtedness (Brazil), and a private sector consumer complaints database in Brazil as well as discussions on Twitter and other social media platforms about financial service providers acting unfairly or disrespectfully.</description>

      <description>Collecting between 240 and 300 interviews in four to six countries as well as direct observations of consumers, this project asks individuals when they have experienced (or believed they would experience) disrespect or respect while trying to access formal financial services. The project also asks how they evade, manage, or transform these experiences as well as what these strategies look like and how they are remembered (visualized). The country teams available to participate are in Brazil, Argentina, Kenya, South Africa, India, and Russia.</description>
