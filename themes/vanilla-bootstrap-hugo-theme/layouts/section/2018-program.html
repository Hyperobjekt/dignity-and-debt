    <span tabindex="0">Why are we talking about dignity when talking about debt? Autonomy and protection from abuse. Does debt necessarily erode a person’s autonomy as she decides who she is and to behave as is she has a sense of free will? And when debt result from exploitation and abuse? Can we re-imagine a world in which debt does not have to accompany indignity?</span>

    <span tabindex="0">The book Getting Respect: Responding to Stigma and Discrimination in the United States, Brazil, and Israel (2016) asked how the search for respect shaped how individuals navigated social interactions where they were likely to be disrespected (or believed that they would be). What if a similar question were asked about respect in the context of financial services? And what if a book were written based on experiences in the US, India, Brazil, Argentina, Kenya, South Africa, and elsewhere? What might we learn about the price people are willing to pay to evade situations of acute disrespect and how might financial services be structured to relieve them of those costs while diverting those resources to more productive endeavors? What are different models for structuring debt that attend to gender differences in how respect is activated and mobilized? And how might we navigate a path between experiments and audits, on the one hand, and in-depth interviews and longer-term observations, on the other?</span>
