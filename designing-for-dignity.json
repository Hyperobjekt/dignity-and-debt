The project would include measures of dignity and respect to assess whether dignity has a payoff for service providers (repayment likelihoods) and for consumers (attitudes towards financial services, their willingness to pursue full financial inclusion, and their financial well-being).  The project would also develop a small team of research fellows for ongoing computational analyses.
